# Cell-Simulation
Just a cell simulation, will be eventually hosted on my github.io
This project will include a machine learning technique called Neural Networks (albeit, I will probably make a very bad one).
Implementing my interpretation of a genetic algorithm.
So, Simulating an ecosystem.


## THIS IS AN ACTIVE PROJECT
* This is my AP Computer science Principals Final project.

### Why
* I just found it interesting, I have been wanting to do it for a while.

* ## TO-DO:
  * Make a run function
  * Use PyGame to create a UI for each cell

* ## Future:
  * Implement this in something like unity
    * So you can visualize "higher beings" (3D animals (like dogs) and plants)
    * Hopefully implement plants and have the animals be able to interact with almost all of their enviroment
  * Name it
  * Make it have different processes based on real life animals.
  * Civilization? (animals can create houses and shelter.)
  * make it like rainworld having an extremely complex ecosystem
  * optimize for gpu and cpu
